This files are part of my little openframeworks addons.

- ofxGlutTimer is simple timer that use the Glut timeout function
- ofxGuiTooOsc is simple bridge between ofxSimpleGuiToo and ofxOsc
- ofxUVCVideoGrabber lets you capture video from an UVC camera on OSX and adjust the camera settings (exposure, white balance, ...). It's based on ofxQTKitVideoGrabber and PhobosLab's UVC Camera Control class.

- tmGuiToo are some personalized controls to be used with ofxSimpleGuiToo (MSAlibs)
- tmOpenCv are some extensions to ofxOpenCv
- tmUtils are some basic classes I didn't found somewhere else (or I was to lasy to look for...)
